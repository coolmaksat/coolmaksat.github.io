 abstract = {Tomato is the most economically important
horticultural crop used as a model to study plant
biology and particularly fruit
development. Knowledge obtained from tomato research
initiated improvements in tomato and, being
transferrable to other such economically important
crops, has led to a surge of tomato-related research
and published literature. We developed DES-TOMATO
knowledgebase (KB) for exploration of information
related to tomato. Information exploration is
enabled through terms from 26 dictionaries and
combination of these terms. To illustrate the
utility of DES-TOMATO, we provide several examples
how one can efficiently use this KB to retrieve
known or potentially novel information. DES-TOMATO
is free for academic and nonprofit users and can be
accessed at http://cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/des_tomato/,
using any of the mainstream web browsers, including
Firefox, Safari and Chrome.},
