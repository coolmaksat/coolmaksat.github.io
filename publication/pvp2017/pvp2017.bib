 abstract = {Discriminating the causative disease variant(s)
for individuals with inherited or de novo mutations
presents one of the main challenges faced by the
clinical genetics community today. Computational
approaches for variant prioritization include
machine learning methods utilizing a large number of
features, including molecular information,
interaction networks, or phenotypes. Here, we
demonstrate the PhenomeNET Variant Predictor (PVP)
system that exploits semantic technologies and
automated reasoning over genotype-phenotype
relations to filter and prioritize variants in whole
exome and whole genome sequencing datasets. We
demonstrate the performance of PVP in identifying
causative variants on a large number of synthetic
whole exome and whole genome sequences, covering a
wide range of diseases and syndromes. In a
retrospective study, we further illustrate the
application of PVP for the interpretation of whole
exome sequencing data in patients suffering from
congenital hypothyroidism. We find that PVP
accurately identifies causative variants in whole
exome and whole genome sequencing datasets and
provides a powerful resource for the discovery of
causal variants.},
