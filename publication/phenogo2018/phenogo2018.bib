Motivation
Function annotations of gene products, and phenotype annotations of
genotypes, provide valuable information about
molecular mechanisms that can be utilized by
computational methods to identify functional and
phenotypic relatedness, improve our understanding of
disease and pathobiology, and lead to discovery of
drug targets. Identifying functions and phenotypes
commonly requires experiments which are
time-consuming and expensive to carry out; creating
the annotations additionally requires a curator to
make an assertion based on reported
evidence. Support to validate the mutual consistency
of functional and phenotype annotations as well as a
computational method to predict phenotypes from
function annotations, would greatly improve the
utility of function annotations.

Results
We developed a novel ontology-based method to validate the mutual
consistency of function and phenotype
annotations. We apply our method to mouse and human
annotations, and identify several inconsistencies
that can be resolved to improve overall annotation
quality. We also apply our method to the rule-based
prediction of regulatory phenotypes from functions
and demonstrate that we can predict these phenotypes
with Fmax of up to 0.647.},
