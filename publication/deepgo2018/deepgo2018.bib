 abstract = {Motivation
A large number of protein sequences are becoming available through the
application of novel high-throughput sequencing
technologies. Experimental functional
characterization of these proteins is time-consuming
and expensive, and is often only done rigorously for
few selected model organisms. Computational function
prediction approaches have been suggested to fill
this gap. The functions of proteins are classified
using the Gene Ontology (GO), which contains over
40 000 classes. Additionally, proteins have multiple
functions, making function prediction a large-scale,
multi-class, multi-label problem.

Results
We have developed a novel method to predict protein function from
sequence. We use deep learning to learn features
from protein sequences as well as a cross-species
protein–protein interaction network. Our approach
specifically outputs information in the structure of
the GO and utilizes the dependencies between GO
classes as background information to construct a
deep learning model. We evaluate our method using
the standards established by the Computational
Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA) and
demonstrate a significant improvement over baseline
methods such as BLAST, in particular for predicting
cellular locations.},
