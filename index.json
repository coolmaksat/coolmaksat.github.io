    "summary": "MotivationFunction annotations of gene products, and phenotype annotations ofgenotypes, provide valuable information aboutmolecular mechanisms that can be utilized bycomputational methods to identify functional andphenotypic relatedness, improve our understanding ofdisease and pathobiology, and lead to discovery ofdrug targets. Identifying functions and phenotypescommonly requires experiments which aretime-consuming and expensive to carry out; creatingthe annotations additionally requires a curator tomake an assertion based on reportedevidence. Support to validate the mutual consistencyof functional and phenotype annotations as well as acomputational method to predict phenotypes fromfunction annotations, would greatly improve theutility of function annotations.ResultsWe developed a novel ontology-based method to validate the mutualconsistency of function and phenotypeannotations. We apply our method to mouse and humanannotations, and identify several inconsistenciesthat can be resolved to improve overall annotationquality. We also apply our method to the rule-basedprediction of regulatory phenotypes from functionsand demonstrate that we can predict these phenotypeswith Fmax of up to 0.647.",

    "summary": "Motivation A large number of protein sequences are becoming available through theapplication of novel high-throughput sequencingtechnologies. Experimental functionalcharacterization of these proteins is time-consumingand expensive, and is often only done rigorously forfew selected model organisms. Computational functionprediction approaches have been suggested to fillthis gap. The functions of proteins are classifiedusing the Gene Ontology (GO), which contains over40 000 classes. Additionally, proteins have multiplefunctions, making function prediction a large-scale,multi-class, multi-label problem.ResultsWe have developed a novel method to predict protein function fromsequence. We use deep learning to learn featuresfrom protein sequences as well as a cross-speciesprotein–protein interaction network. Our approachspecifically outputs information in the structure ofthe GO and utilizes the dependencies between GOclasses as background information to construct adeep learning model. We evaluate our method usingthe standards established by the ComputationalAssessment of Function Annotation (CAFA) anddemonstrate a significant improvement over baselinemethods such as BLAST, in particular for predictingcellular locations.",

Here, wedemonstrate the PhenomeNET Variant Predictor (PVP)system that exploits semantic technologies andautomated reasoning over genotype-phenotyperelations to filter and prioritize variants in wholeexome and whole genome sequencing datasets. Wedemonstrate the performance of PVP in identifyingcausative variants on a large number of syntheticwhole exome and whole genome sequences, covering awide range of diseases and syndromes. In aretrospective study, we further illustrate theapplication of PVP for the interpretation of wholeexome sequencing data in patients suffering fromcongenital hypothyroidism.

We find that most similarity measures aresensitive to the number of annotations of entities,difference in annotation size as well as to thedepth of annotation classes; well-studied and richlyannotated entities will usually show highersimilarity than entities with only few annotationseven in the absence of any biological relation.ConclusionsOur findings may have significant impact on the interpretation ofresults that rely on measures of semanticsimilarity, and we demonstrate how the sensitivityto annotation size can lead to a bias when usingsemantic similarity to predict protein-proteininteractions.",
